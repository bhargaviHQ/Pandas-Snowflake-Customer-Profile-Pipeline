# Data Engineering Pipelines with pandas on Snowflake

## Overview

The project is done as aprt of the Build End to End Python Pipelines in Snowflake hands-on lab by Snowflake on October 30, 2024.

Utilized [Pandas on Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowpark/python/snowpark-pandas) to create a customer profile by analyzing the [Snowflake Sample TPC-H dataset](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-tpch). Successfully saved the results into a Snowflake table and implemented a serverless task to schedule the feature engineering pipeline.
